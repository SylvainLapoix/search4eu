## 1. The technical stack


---

## Aleph

> *Truth cannot penetrate a closed mind. If all places in the universe are in the Aleph, then all stars, all lamps, all sources of light are in it, too.* — **The Aleph**, Jorge Luis Borges

--

[Aleph](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph) is a technical tool for indexing, scraping and browsing large amount of structured and unstructured data sources. It is entirely open-source.

The tool is used and maintained by several organisations dedicated to investigating corruption and organized crime across the globe, such as Code for Africa and OpenOil, to the benefit of many medias.

Our interest in Aleph lies in three main features :
* **scraping** (via OCR and advanced parsing) ;
* **entity mapping** (identification and connection of named entities in docs) ;
* **indexation** (for browsing, including front-end).

---

## Memorious

> *The solitary and lucid spectator of a multiform, instantaneous and almost intolerably precise world.* — **Funes the Memorious**, Jorge Luis Borges

--

Memorious is the module of the Aleph toolkit dedicated to crawling and scraping documents.

It works as a framework. Meaning it handles several smaller programs to execute several tasks with interaction and timing. It allows to schedule crawlers, combine multiple methods, distribute tasks across machines, etc.

Our interest in Memorious is three-fold :
* it allows us to **crawl** a large number of website ;
* it gives us a toolkit to build **custom crawlers** but also **processing scripts** to extract and structure data from sources ;
* it works in sync with Aleph, allowing **regular and automated updates of our databases**.

Our work consists in configuring, coordinating and, if necessary, completing both Aleph and Memorious to create custom search engines designed specifically for the topics covered.

In practice :
1. we set up crawlers in Memorious to target the websites that may publish relevant documents ;
2. we store the results to feed them to Aleph ;
3. we configure Aleph to map entities and index documents to make them accessible in a seach-engine interface.
